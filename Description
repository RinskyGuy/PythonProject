Functions (task 1):
	The purpose of Task 1 is to imitate a bank application.
	The application has functions for creating accounts, transfer money, deposit, 
  withdrawal and transactions log.

Search and Analytics (task 2):
	The purpose of Task 2 is to show words which include/exclude a specific letter (char)
  entered by the user. It iterates through the file and returns words that match the 
  userâ€™s input. 

  User sets the type of search (include/exclude) by radio buttons. The application 
  also includes an analytic bar graph displaying frequency of each letter existing in 
  the database (this was limited to letters from A to J due to assignment constraints)
